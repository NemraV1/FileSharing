File Transfer Script 

This repository contains a Python script for sending files from one computer to another using the recipient's IP address. The script provides the recipient with the flexibility to accept or decline incoming files.

How It Works
Sender: You will need to run the Python script on the sending computer (PC A). This script allows you to select a file and enter the recipient's IP address.

Receiver: On the receiving computer (PC B), the recipient should have the software running to accept incoming files.
Don't forget to set the correct Ip adress and oppended the port 

Update 10/09 : Added executable file for sender and receiver
